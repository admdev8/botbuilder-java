# Teams Messaging Extension Search Auth Config Bot

Bot Framework v4 Conversation Bot sample for Teams.

This bot has been created using [Bot Framework](https://dev.botframework.com). This sample shows
how to incorporate basic conversational flow into a Teams application. It also illustrates a few of the Teams specific calls you can make from your bot.

## Prerequisites

- Microsoft Teams is installed and you have an account
- [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/) or equivalent tunnelling solution

## To try this sample

> Note these instructions are for running the sample on your local machine, the tunnelling solution is required because
the Teams service needs to call into the bot.

1) Clone the repository

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Microsoft/botbuilder-java.git
    ```

1) Run ngrok - point to port 8080

    ```bash
    ngrok http -host-header=rewrite 8080
    ```

1) Create [Bot Framework registration resource](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/bot-service/bot-service-quickstart-registration) in Azure
    - Use the current `https` URL you were given by running ngrok. Append with the path `/api/messages` used by this sample
    - Ensure that you've [enabled the Teams Channel](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/bot-service/channel-connect-teams?view=azure-bot-service-4.0)
    - __*If you don't have an Azure account*__ you can use this [Bot Framework registration](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoftteams/platform/bots/how-to/create-a-bot-for-teams#register-your-web-service-with-the-bot-framework)
    
1) [Add Authentication to your bot via Azure Bot Service](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/bot-service/bot-builder-authentication?view=azure-bot-service-4.0&tabs=csharp)

1) Update the `resources/application.properties` configuration for the bot to use the `MicrosoftAppId`, `MicrosfotAppPassword`, `ConnectionName`, and `SiteUrl` from the Bot Framework registration. (Note the App Password is referred to as the "client secret" in the azure portal and you can always create a new client secret anytime.)

1) __*This step is specific to Teams.*__
    - **Edit** the `manifest.json` contained in the  `teamsAppManifest` folder to replace your Microsoft App Id (that was created when you registered your bot earlier) *everywhere* you see the place holder string `<<YOUR-MICROSOFT-APP-ID>>` (depending on the scenario the Microsoft App Id may occur multiple times in the `manifest.json`)
    - **Zip** up the contents of the `teamsAppManifest` folder to create a `manifest.zip`
    - **Upload** the `manifest.zip` to Teams (in the Apps view click "Upload a custom app")

1) From the root of this project folder:
    - Build the sample using `mvn package`
    - Unless done previously, install the packages in the local cache by using `mvn install`
    - Run it by using `java -jar .\target\bot-teams-messaging-extensions-search-auth-config-sample.jar`


## Interacting with the bot in Teams

Once the Messaging Extension is installed, click the icon for **Config Auth Search** in the Compose Box's Messaging Extension menu to display the search window.  Left click to choose **Settings** and view the Config page.

### Avoiding Permission-Related Errors

You may encounter permission-related errors when sending a proactive message. This can often be mitigated by using `MicrosoftAppCredentials.TrustServiceUrl()`. See [the documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/bot-service/bot-builder-howto-proactive-message?view=azure-bot-service-4.0&tabs=csharp#avoiding-401-unauthorized-errors) for more information.

## Deploy the bot to Azure
